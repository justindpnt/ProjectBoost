# Project Boost

A platformer with the goal to move the shuttle from the launching pad to the 
landing pad, overcoming all the obstacles along the way.

## Controls

Use the left and right arrow keys to move, and use the spacebar to control the thrust. 

## Notes

Being as this is my first 3D game in Unity, the classes are not split up as ideally as I
would imagine. This project was more about understanding the main components of a 3D unity
game. My future 3D Unity projects will have the classes divided in a more intuitive manner.
